# INSERTING DATA AND NULL HANDLING
## 1. Data Insertion Description
The database student_attendance_system was successfully used to populate initial data across all core tables using INSERT INTO statements:

#### Department Table

- Inserted 2 departments:

    - 1 → Computer Science

    - 2 → Mechanical

#### Student Table

- Inserted 2 students:

    - 101 → bala, Email: bala@gmail.com, Department: Computer Science

    - 102 → bhargavi, Email: bhargavi@gmail.com, Department: Mechanical

#### Course Table

- Inserted 4 courses:

    - DBMS, Thermodynamics, and two C courses offered by both departments.

#### Class Table

- Added 4 class sessions linked to the above courses:

    - Each with a course ID, date, and assigned faculty (e.g., Prof. Ramesh, Asst. Sai Kumar)

#### Attendance Table

- Recorded student attendance for specific classes:

    - Each entry includes student ID, class ID, and attendance status (present or absent).

All insertions were successful with zero warnings or duplicate entries. The data is now ready for further manipulation using UPDATE, DELETE, and NULL handling operations.


### 2. Viewing Inserted Data (Select Queries)
After inserting values into all tables, the following 
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name; commands were executed to verify the contents of the database.
```

This confirms that the data was successfully inserted and reflects correct relationships between entities in the student attendance system.


### 3. Update & Delete Operations
This section showcases how records in the attendance, student, and course tables are updated or deleted using SQL statements.

#### Update Operations

Updating Attendance Status

```sql
UPDATE attendance SET status = 'present' WHERE atd_id = 402;
```

- Updates the status of the record with atd_id = 402 from 'absent' to 'present'.

Updating Student Email

```sql
UPDATE student SET std_email = 'bala05@gmail.com' WHERE std_id = 101;
```

- Changes the email of student 101 to 'bala05@gmail.com'.

#### Delete Operations with Constraints

Deleting a Course Record

```sql
DELETE FROM course WHERE course_id = 204;
```

- Failed due to foreign key constraint: The course is referenced in the class table.

Deleting Courses by Department

```sql
DELETE FROM course WHERE dept_id = 2;
```

- Failed for the same reason — courses from department 2 are referenced elsewhere.

Successful Delete

Deleting an Attendance Record

```sql
DELETE FROM attendance WHERE atd_id = 404;
```

- Successfully removed the record for atd_id = 404 since it was not referenced by any other table.

### Notes:

- Foreign Key Constraints prevent deleting rows that are being referenced in other tables (like class referencing course).

- To safely delete such records, dependent rows must be removed first (e.g., delete class entries before deleting a course).

- This confirms the integrity enforcement of the relational model in your student attendance system.


### 4. NULL Handling

- Inserting a student without email (nullable column):

```sql
INSERT INTO student (std_id, std_name, std_email, dept_id) VALUES (103, 'Maze', NULL, 1);
```

- Try inserting NULL in status (non-nullable, will cause error):

-- This should fail (for learning)
```sql    
INSERT INTO attendance (atd_id, std_id, class_id, status) VALUES (405, 103, 301, NULL);
```

- Optional: Add a student with missing department (NULL foreign key):

```sql
INSERT INTO student (std_id, std_name, std_email, dept_id) VALUES (104, 'Akhil', 'akhil@gmail.com', NULL);
```

- To see the changes Which are done upto now

```sql
SELECT * FROM attendance;
SELECT * FROM student;
```
